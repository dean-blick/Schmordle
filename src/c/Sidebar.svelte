          This version of Wordle, called "Schmordle", has some special rules and features. The word list is significantly harder than
          the typical version of Wordle. This version also allows any combination of letters as opposed to requiring a valid word guess.
          <br><br> There is also a feature that allows you to implement your own word and get a link that you can paste or send to a friend
          if the website is being hosted.
